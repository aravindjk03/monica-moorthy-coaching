# Enable GitHub Pages

## Manual Setup Required

Since the automated setup failed, please follow these steps:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/aravindjk03/monica-moorthy-coaching/settings/pages

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - Click **"Save"**

3. **The website will be available at**:
   - https://aravindjk03.github.io/monica-moorthy-coaching/

4. **Re-run the failed workflow**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/aravindjk03/monica-moorthy-coaching/actions
   - Click on the failed workflow run
   - Click "Re-run all jobs"

The build process is working correctly - we just need to enable GitHub Pages first!
